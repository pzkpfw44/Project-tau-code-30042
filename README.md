❖ Requirements
Tau Compiler v7.3.91 or later

S-Core (aligned)

Grav-c with anisotropic bleed

Q-Filament Interface (QFI-tested)

Local t declustered and null-biased

Harmonic cooling reservoir (min. 3.2K)

❖ Setup
Stabilize the environment.
All operations must occur in a vacuum-resonant chamber or cryo-harmonic hull. Ensure no residual memory fields are present within 1.2π meters of the array.

Initialize the Tau Compiler.
Run with --fold-safe and --echo-strict flags.
Avoid --recursive-weave unless path collapse has been externally verified.

Verify glyph integrity.
Hash of the primary tau-knot.vae file must match the following:
ΘA9F-23B1-ΓψΞ
Failure to match indicates corruption or entropic drift.

Pre-weaving cooldown.
Chill processing core to ≤3.2K before the first chant.
C-lattices are sensitive to thermic interference; premature threading risks irreversible tangle.

Seal t vents.
Open threads during resonance may attract roaming vectors.
Use μ-field dampeners on all exposed anchor points.

❖ Execution
tau compile tau-knot.vae --fold-safe --chant ∇

Monitor the ∂t•x•ψ stream for pulse stabilization.
If ∂t readings exceed 11:3, abort and reweave using a mirrored lattice.

Do not interrupt entangle:core mid-fold.
Disruption during spin binding has resulted in echo bleed in previous iterations.

❖ Safety Protocols
DO NOT use on shared machines.
Backup your baryon signature. You will not be notified before overwrite.
Residual glyphlight may induce memory distortions.
Execute only in isolated t-windows. Nearby entangled systems may collapse recursively (theorised only, not observed yet).

❖ Known Anomalies
Inverted entropy trail on some hardware using ∆spin cores
Spontaneous initiation of fallback.reverb despite stable vector fields
Logless reboots during signature glyph.seal events (harmless, mostly)
